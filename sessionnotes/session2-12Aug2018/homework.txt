Create a program in java,
Where we have 2 operatands and different operators simulations.

Have two variable a & b with random values.


If

a is greater than b
then the result should be printed as operation : a*b;

b is greater than a
then the result should be printed as operation : b/a;

if a is equal to b
then  the result should be right bit shift of a for b a>>b;

Sample :

a = 12, b = 12
0

a = 3, b = 2
6

a = 2, b = 6
 3
